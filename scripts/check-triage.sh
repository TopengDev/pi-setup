# check-triage.sh — shared triage gate validator for the 3-tier task hierarchy.
#
# Usage: check-triage.sh <window_name> [<task_dir>]
#
# Resolves the task's triage.json, validates it, and enforces:
#   - triage.json MUST exist for the task being spawned
#   - level MUST be one of L1 / L2 / L3
#   - if level == L3, signoff MUST be true (user's explicit approval)
#
# triage.json schema (one per task, in the task notes dir beside STATE.md):
#   {
#     "task_slug": "<slug>",
#     "level":     "L1|L2|L3",
#     "scope":     "<one line>",
#     "created":   "<ISO ts>",
#     "signoff":   false        # L3 only: flips true after The User approves
#   }
#
# Resolution order for finding triage.json:
#   1. Explicit: <task_dir> arg ($2) OR $TASK_DIR env  ->  "<dir>/triage.json"
#   2. Convention/glob: ~/claude/notes/<window_name>-*/triage.json, newest by mtime
#      (the task notes dir is conventionally "<window-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>")
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  triage valid                  -> spawn ALLOWED
#   1  blocked (missing/invalid/L3-unsigned) -> reason on stderr
#   2  internal/usage error          -> caller decides:
#        - spawn-worker.sh: warns + fails OPEN (don't brick spawning on infra bug)
#        - PreToolUse hook: fails OPEN (never brick a Bash command on our bug)
#
# This is the single source of truth for the gate logic, shared by:
#   - your scripts/spawn-worker.sh        (PRIMARY, fail-closed at spawn)
#   - your hooks/triage-gate-hook.sh      (SECONDARY, PreToolUse belt-and-suspenders)
