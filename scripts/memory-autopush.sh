# memory-autopush.sh — auto-commit + push the live memory dir to its PRIVATE remote.
#
# The live claude memory dir (Claude Code's autoMemoryDirectory) physically lives
# inside {{DOTFILES_REPO}}/claude/memory/ and is its OWN git repo with a PRIVATE
# remote (TopengDev/claude-memory). chilldawg gitignores this dir, so the nested
# repo is invisible to it. This script keeps the private backup current.
#
# Driven by: config/systemd/user/memory-autopush.timer (every 30 min, Persistent).
# Safe to run manually anytime. Idempotent — commits only when there's a change.
#
# Design notes:
#   * Resolve the memory dir via the ~/.pi/agent/memory symlink so this works no
#     matter where the script is invoked from (cron/systemd has no useful CWD).
#   * `git add -A` then commit ONLY if the index is dirty (no empty commits).
#   * Timestamp from `date` (runs in a real shell — fine, no Date.now footgun).
#   * Never `set -e` around the push: a transient network failure must not crash
#     the unit loudly every 30 min; we log + exit non-zero so `systemctl status`
#     shows it, but the next timer tick simply retries (commits accumulate, then
#     push when connectivity returns).
#   * The global pre-push secret-scan hook still runs on the push — if memory ever
#     gains a real secret, the push is (correctly) blocked and this logs it.
