argument-hint: [description of the asset to create]
---

## Overview

Multi-phase design loop that generates professional-quality visual assets. Routes to the best AI image model for each asset type. Quality bar is HIGH — bad or ugly output is worse than nothing.

### MANDATORY — Load Design Theory Before Ideation

**Before Phase 2 (Design Concept), READ `design-theory.md` in this skill directory.** This file contains 35 design theories across 5 tiers (Visual Fundamentals, Color Theory, Typography, Layout & Composition, Advanced Conceptual). Every design decision must be informed by these principles. Every self-critique must evaluate against them. If a generated output violates Gestalt, hierarchy, contrast, balance, or any core principle — reject and iterate.

### HARD BANS — Auto-Reject if ANY of These Appear

These are NOT suggestions — they are HARD REJECTIONS. If ANY of the following appear in generated output, the output MUST be rejected and regenerated. No exceptions. Prepend these constraints to EVERY generation prompt.

1. **NO gradient backgrounds** of any kind (linear, radial, mesh — all banned)
2. **NO glow/aura/neon effects** behind text or elements
3. **NO drop shadows** on text or elements
4. **NO centered symmetric layouts** — every composition must be asymmetric
5. **NO generic sans-serif** — must specify exact style (condensed/extended/geometric/grotesque/humanist)
6. **NO 3D phone/laptop/device mockups** — no "app in a phone" templates
7. **NO floating UI elements** without spatial context or ground
8. **NO abstract blob shapes** — amorphous gradient blobs are banned
9. **NO isometric illustrations** — generic tech-startup isometric art is banned
10. **NO generic "tech" visuals** — circuits, binary code, particles, digital waves, matrix rain
11. **NO lens flare / light leaks** — photographic artifacts as decoration
12. **NO soft pastel color palettes** — washed-out pastels = generic
13. **NO rounded rectangle "app card" aesthetic** — the Dribbble-card template look
14. **NO glassmorphism/blur cards** — frosted glass overlays as a design crutch
15. **NO geometric pattern fills** — triangles/hexagons/dots as background texture
16. **NO starburst / radial burst** behind text or focal element
17. **NO stock photo compositing** — no pasted-in stock imagery
18. **NO generic icon grids** — grid of 6 identical-style icons with labels
19. **NO "SaaS landing page" template look** — if it looks like a Webflow template, reject
20. **NO decoration that doesn't serve a purpose** — every element must have a reason

**Self-critique checkpoint:** After every generation, scan for ALL 20 bans. If even ONE appears, reject the output entirely and regenerate with an explicitly revised prompt that addresses the specific violation. Do not attempt to fix via editing — regenerate from scratch.

### Hard Bans → Negative Prompt Mapping

Wire the 20 hard bans into model-specific negative prompt formatting. Every generation prompt MUST include the relevant negative phrases.

#### Ban-to-Phrase Lookup Table

| 20 | No purposeless decoration | "no decorative elements, no unnecessary ornament, no filler decoration, no pointless embellishment" |

#### Model-Specific Formatting

**Gemini (Vertex AI API via curl):**
Append to the generation prompt as a "Do not include" block:
```
Do not include: [comma-separated list of relevant negative phrases from table above]
```

**GPT Image (OpenAI API):**
Inline directly in the prompt text as an "Avoid" section:
```
Avoid the following: [comma-separated negative phrases]
```

**FLUX.2 Pro (BFL API):**
Use the `negative_prompt` field:
```json
{ "negative_prompt": "[comma-separated negative phrases]" }
```

#### Usage

1. Start with the archetype's negative keywords (from Vibe Archetypes section)
2. Append ALL 20 hard ban phrases (always included, regardless of archetype)
3. Add any user-specified constraints
4. Format according to the target model's syntax above

### Available Models

| Model | API | Best For | Cost |
|-------|-----|----------|------|
| **Gemini (Imagen)** | Vertex AI API (`$GEMINI_API_KEY`) via curl | Social graphics, general illustrations, text-heavy | $0.045-0.134/img |
| **GPT Image 1.5** | `curl` OpenAI API (`$OPENAI_API_KEY`) | Text-heavy banners, iterative editing, highest overall quality | $0.009-0.133/img |
| **FLUX.2 Pro** | `curl` BFL API (`$BFL_API_KEY`) | Photorealistic mockups, product photography | $0.03-0.055/img |

### Model Availability Check

Before routing, verify which models are actually available:
1. **Gemini** — check `$GEMINI_API_KEY` in env. Use curl if available.
2. **GPT Image 1.5** — check `$OPENAI_API_KEY` in env. Use curl if available.
3. **FLUX.2** — check `$BFL_API_KEY` in env. Use curl if available.

If a model is unavailable, fall back to the next best option. Gemini is always the fallback. If NO API keys are available, tell the user which keys are needed.

### pi-Specific Tool Usage

All generation is done via the `bash` tool (curl API calls). Use `read` to view generated images, `write` to save final outputs. Output directory: `/tmp/creative-output/`.

## Interactive Setup

Before generating any asset, run this setup sequence. Present it conversationally — don't dump the whole menu.

### Step 1: Mode Selection

| Mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| **New** | Creating from scratch — full creative latitude |
| **Redesign** | Existing asset needs a visual overhaul or style change |
| **Quick Polish** | Existing asset, minor adjustments — color, crop, text fix |
| **Surprise Me** | User trusts you completely — pick archetype, dials, everything |

### Step 2: Archetype Selection

Present the archetypes from the Vibe Archetypes section below, or let the user describe a custom vibe. If "Surprise Me," pick the archetype that best fits their content/domain and commit fully.

### Step 3: Dial Confirmation

Present three dials with archetype defaults. Let the user override or accept.

| Dial | 1–3 | 4–7 | 8–10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DESIGN_VARIANCE** | Centered, symmetric, safe compositions | Offset focal points, asymmetric balance, rule-of-thirds | Extreme cropping, broken frames, overlapping elements, experimental |
| **MOTION_INTENSITY** | Static image, no implied movement | Dynamic angles, diagonal lines, implied velocity | Extreme perspective, motion blur, kinetic energy, explosive |
| **VISUAL_DENSITY** | Minimal elements, maximum negative space | Balanced composition, 3-5 elements | Dense, layered, information-rich, collage-like |

### Custom Vibe
When the user describes something that doesn't match an archetype, extract:
1. Color temperature (warm / cool / neutral)
2. Density feeling (sparse / balanced / dense)
3. Personality (serious / playful / luxe / raw / futuristic / organic)
4. Reference points (any styles, brands, or aesthetics they mention)

Build a complete palette + composition + keyword set from those constraints, following the same structure as the archetypes above.

---

## Phase 1 — Brief Decomposition

Parse the user's request into structured parameters. If anything is ambiguous, ask ONE round of clarifying questions — don't guess on critical dimensions.

Extract:

```
ASSET_TYPE:    social | illustration | logo | banner | icon | mockup | general
DIMENSIONS:    width x height (or aspect ratio)
MEDIUM:        digital (default) | print | web-optimized
BRAND:         load brand-kit.json if exists in cwd or project root
MOOD:          professional | playful | minimal | bold | elegant | technical | warm | cool
AUDIENCE:      who sees this (informs tone)
COMPOSITION:   what goes where (text placement, focal point, negative space)
TEXT_CONTENT:   any text that must appear IN the image (headlines, taglines, labels)
REFERENCES:    any reference images or style directions the user provided
```

### Brand Kit Loading

Search for `brand-kit.json` in the current directory and parent directories. If found, load it and apply constraints. Use the `bash` tool:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "brand-kit.json" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Brand kit fields override defaults:
- `colors.primary` → use as dominant color
- `colors.secondary` → use as accent
- `typography.heading` → specify in prompt
- `tone` → incorporate into style direction
- `avoid` → add to negative constraints
- `references` → load as style references (if model supports reference images)

---

## Phase 2 — Design Concept (Text-First)

Before generating ANY image, write a design brief in prose. This is the creative direction — the prompt comes from this, not from the raw user request.

### Design Brief Template

```
## Design Concept: [working title]

**Asset type:** [social / illustration / logo / banner / icon / mockup]
**Dimensions:** [WxH or aspect ratio]
**Model:** [which model and why]

### Color Palette
- Primary: [hex] — [rationale]
- Secondary: [hex] — [rationale]
- Accent: [hex] — [rationale]
- Background: [hex or description]

### Composition Plan
- [Layout description — where is the focal point, how is space divided]
- [Visual hierarchy — what draws the eye first, second, third]
- [Negative space usage]

### Typography (if text in image)
- Headline: [font style, size relationship, placement]
- Body/tagline: [font style, placement]
- Text content: "[exact text that must render]"

### Style Direction
- [Mood, aesthetic references, artistic approach]
- [What this should feel like — not just look like]

### Constraints
- Must: [non-negotiable requirements]
- Avoid: [things to explicitly stay away from]
```

**Present the concept to the user.** Wait for approval before generating. If they say "go" or "looks good," proceed. If they adjust, revise the concept first.

---

## Phase 3 — Model Selection + Prompt Engineering

### Routing Logic

Select the model based on asset type AND available models:

| Asset Type | Primary Model | Fallback | Notes |
|------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `social` | **Gemini (Imagen)** | GPT Image | Gemini executes bold compositions best. GPT Image softens everything. |
| `illustration` | Gemini (Imagen) | FLUX.2 | |
| `logo` | GPT Image | Gemini (raster, warn user) | |
| `banner` (text-heavy) | Gemini (Imagen) | GPT Image | Gemini renders type hierarchy better than GPT Image for bold layouts. |
| `icon` | GPT Image | Gemini (raster, warn user) | |
| `mockup` (photorealistic) | FLUX.2 Pro | Gemini | |
| `general` | Gemini (Imagen) | GPT Image | |

### Model Characteristics (Learned from Testing)

**Gemini (Imagen):**
- Executes dramatic compositional choices (oversized cropped type, extreme scale contrast)
- Follows asymmetric layout instructions well
- Good at bold/thin typographic weight contrast
- Responds to design-theory language ("Swiss typographic", "brutalist", "Z-pattern")
- Use fresh generation over edit mode — edits introduce artifacts

**GPT Image 1:**
- Too conservative for bold layouts — softens edges, plays it safe with composition
- Better for precise text rendering when ALL text must be accurate
- Warm-shifts white to cream. Doesn't follow "pure white" instructions.
- Struggles with compositional risk (won't crop type at frame edges)
- Good for structured multi-text layouts where every word matters

**FLUX.2 Pro:**
- Best photorealism, clean output
- Limited typographic control — avoid for text-heavy designs
- Good for product mockups and scenic compositions

If the primary model is unavailable, use the fallback. For social graphics, ALWAYS use Gemini — the bold compositional choices it enables are worth the occasional rendering imperfection.

### Prompt Construction

Build the generation prompt from the Phase 2 concept. Never pass the raw user request directly to the model. **Describe a DESIGNED COMPOSITION, not "a social media post."**

**Prompt structure (SPATIAL-FIRST — describe WHERE things go, not just WHAT):**
1. Background treatment (color, texture — specify grain/noise for depth)
2. Hero element with EXACT spatial placement ("upper-left 40% of frame", "cropped by top edge")
3. Secondary elements with size relationships ("25% the visual size of hero")
4. Accent elements with precise coordinates and dimensions ("teal bar, 3px tall, 38% width, from 4% left margin")
5. Brand/info elements with alignment rules ("left-aligned to same 4% margin", "right-aligned bottom-right")
6. Spatial structure description ("Z-pattern reading path", "strong left-axis alignment", "intentional negative space in center")
7. Anti-patterns to avoid ("NO glow, NO gradient, NO centered, NO decoration")
8. Style references (name specific studios/brands: "Experimental Jetset", "Linear.co", "Spin Studio")

**Key lessons from testing:**
- Describe designs as "poster compositions" not "social media posts" — avoids generic templates
- Specify precise margins and percentages — AI models follow spatial instructions
- Name specific typeface styles ("ultra-bold condensed grotesque", "hairline weight") not just "bold" or "thin"
- The phrase "cropped by the edge of the frame" is understood by Gemini — use it for dramatic oversized type
- Include design theory language — Gemini responds to "Gestalt closure", "Z-pattern", "scale contrast"
- End with strong negative constraints — models follow "NO glow" more reliably than "subtle" or "minimal"

**Read the prompt template file** for the selected asset type from `prompts/` directory:
- `prompts/social.md`
- `prompts/illustration.md`
- `prompts/logo.md`
- `prompts/banner.md`
- `prompts/icon.md`
- `prompts/mockup.md`

Each template has model-specific prompt patterns and known-good modifiers.

### Model-Specific Generation via `bash` Tool

#### Gemini (Vertex AI Imagen)

Use the `bash` tool with curl:
```bash
# Imagen generation via Vertex AI
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/imagen-3.0-generate-001:predict" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "instances": [{
      "prompt": "YOUR PROMPT HERE",
      "negativePrompt": "no glow, no gradient, no centered layout"
    }],
    "parameters": {
      "sampleCount": 1,
      "aspectRatio": "1:1"
    }
  }' | jq -r '.predictions[0].bytesBase64Encoded' | base64 -d > /tmp/creative-output/[name].png
```

Or if using the Gemini API directly (via API key):
```bash
curl -s "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{"parts":[{"text": "Generate an image: YOUR PROMPT HERE"}]}],
    "generationConfig": {"responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]}
  }'
```

Key: Gemini responds well to descriptive, conversational prompts. Include mood and context, not just visual specs.

#### GPT Image 1.5 (OpenAI API)

Use the `bash` tool:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "prompt": "YOUR PROMPT HERE",
    "size": "1024x1024",
    "quality": "medium",
    "n": 1,
    "output_format": "png"
  }'
```

Response contains base64 image data — decode and save:
```bash
echo "$base64_data" | base64 -d > "/tmp/creative-output/[name].png"
```

Key: GPT Image excels with detailed, structured prompts. Be very specific about text placement, font style, and layout. Use "quality": "high" only for final output — use "medium" for iterations.

#### FLUX.2 Pro (BFL API)

Use the `bash` tool:
```bash
# Submit job
TASK_ID=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.bfl.ai/v1/flux-pro-1.1" \
  -H "x-key: $BFL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "YOUR PROMPT HERE",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024
  }' | jq -r '.id')

# Poll for result (wait 5s between polls, max 60s)
for i in $(seq 1 12); do
  RESULT=$(curl -s "https://api.bfl.ai/v1/get_result?id=$TASK_ID" \
    -H "x-key: $BFL_API_KEY")
  STATUS=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.status')
  if [ "$STATUS" = "Ready" ]; then
    URL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.result.sample')
    curl -s -o "/tmp/creative-output/[name].png" "$URL"
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

Key: FLUX prompts should be photographic in nature — describe the scene as if directing a photographer. Include camera angle, lens type, lighting setup, depth of field. Avoid abstract style descriptors.

## Phase 4 — Generate + Self-Critique

### Generation

1. Create output directory: `mkdir -p /tmp/creative-output` (via `bash`)
2. Generate 2 variations using the selected model (3 if logos/icons where consistency matters)
3. Save with descriptive names: `/tmp/creative-output/[asset-type]-[variant]-[timestamp].png`
4. Use the `read` tool to view generated images and evaluate quality

### Self-Critique

After generation, evaluate BRUTALLY against these criteria. Score 1-10. **Be harsh — if you wouldn't post it on Dribbble, it's not an 8.**

| Criterion | What to check | Common failure |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **AI Slop Test** | Does this look AI-generated? Glow effects, generic gradients, centered-everything, stock-photo-feel? If YES to ANY → score 1-3. | This is the #1 failure mode. Most AI output fails here. |
| **Composition** | Is the layout intentional? Asymmetric or deliberately composed? Grid-aligned? Or just "stuff in the middle"? | Centered-everything = max 4/10 |
| **Typography hierarchy** | Multiple sizes/weights/cases? Or one font, one size? Real type hierarchy like a magazine? | Single-weight bold text = max 4/10 |
| **Color strategy** | Is color used surgically (accent line, single element) or sprayed everywhere (gradients, glows, saturation)? | Glow effects = max 3/10 |
| **Negative space** | Is whitespace/darkspace intentional and structured? Or just "big empty background"? | Empty background ≠ good negative space |
| **Distinctiveness** | Could you tell this is for THIS brand without reading the text? Does it have character? | Generic = max 5/10 |
| **Technical quality** | Artifacts, distortion, broken text, weird elements? | |
| **Text accuracy** | Spelled correctly? Legible? Well-placed in the composition? | |

**Scoring (CALIBRATED — be honest):**
- 9-10: Portfolio-worthy. A designer would be proud. Extremely rare from AI.
- 7-8: Good design with minor issues. Passes the "would I post this?" test.
- 5-6: Mediocre. Has some design thinking but also has AI slop patterns.
- 3-4: Bad. Generic AI output with centered text and glow effects.
- 1-2: Embarrassing. Would damage the brand if posted.

**REJECT THRESHOLD: Below 6 → regenerate with fundamentally different prompt (not just tweaks).** Below 4 → switch models.

Present the critique to the user with the images. Let them pick which variation to refine.

---

## Phase 5 — Iterative Refinement

Take the user's chosen variation and refine it. Maximum 3 refinement cycles.

### Refinement Strategy by Model

- **Gemini**: Regenerate with adjusted prompt. Provide precise feedback on what changed.
- **GPT Image**: Use the edits endpoint with mask for targeted edits, or regenerate with refined prompt.
- **FLUX.2**: Regenerate with refined prompt.

### What to Refine

Based on the critique scores, focus refinement on the lowest-scoring criteria:
- Color issues → adjust palette in prompt, specify hex values
- Composition → describe spatial relationships more precisely
- Text errors → re-specify text with emphasis on exact spelling
- Technical artifacts → regenerate with higher quality setting
- Style mismatch → add/remove style modifiers

### When to Stop

Stop refining when:
- All criteria score 7+ AND at least 3 criteria score 8+
- The user says they're happy
- You've hit 3 refinement cycles (diminishing returns — offer to restart with a different approach)

---

## Phase 6 — Quality Gate + Delivery

### Final Assessment

Run the critique one last time on the final output. Present:

```
## Final Output

**File:** /tmp/creative-output/[filename]
**Model used:** [model name]
**Dimensions:** [WxH]
**Format:** [PNG/SVG/JPG]

### Design Rationale
[Brief explanation of the creative decisions — why these colors, this composition, this style]

### Quality Scores
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Color harmony | X/10 |
| Visual hierarchy | X/10 |
| Composition | X/10 |
| Brand alignment | X/10 |
| Technical quality | X/10 |
| Text accuracy | X/10 (or N/A) |
| Professional polish | X/10 |
| **Overall** | **X/10** |

### Files Delivered
- [list all output files with paths]
```

### Output Organization

Save final outputs to a structured location:
- Working directory: `/tmp/creative-output/` (ephemeral, for iteration)
- If the user wants to keep the asset, copy to their project directory
- Use `write` tool to save assets to project directories

### Post-Delivery Options

After delivery, offer:
- "Want me to adjust anything?" → back to Phase 5
- "Want variations in a different style?" → back to Phase 2 with new concept
- "Want this in different sizes?" → regenerate with adjusted dimensions
- "Want to save the brand kit?" → offer to create/update brand-kit.json

## Appendix A — Quality Anti-Patterns

Things that make AI-generated design assets look bad. Avoid these in prompts:

### Visual Anti-Patterns
- **Over-saturated colors** — dial back saturation, use muted/professional palettes
- **Too many elements** — less is more. Professional design is about restraint.
- **Centered-everything syndrome** — asymmetric layouts feel more designed
- **Generic stock photo look** — specify concrete details (real locations, specific objects)
- **Gradient overload** — one subtle gradient max, not rainbow gradients
- **Floating elements with no ground** — give elements context and spatial relationships
- **AI hands/fingers** — avoid compositions where hands are prominent
- **Tiny illegible text** — if text must appear, make it large and central

### Prompt Anti-Patterns
- **"Beautiful, stunning, amazing"** — empty adjectives don't improve output
- **"HD, 4K, 8K, ultra-realistic"** — quality tags are mostly noise for modern models
- **Conflicting styles** — don't ask for "minimalist AND detailed AND busy AND clean"
- **Overly long prompts** — for most models, 50-150 words is the sweet spot
- **Negative prompts as primary direction** — describe what you WANT, not just what to avoid

## Appendix B — Text Rendering Tips

Text in AI images is the hardest thing to get right. Follow these rules:

1. **Keep text short** — 1-5 words renders best. Longer text = more errors.
2. **Put text in quotes** in the prompt — `with the text "SALE"` not `with the text SALE`
3. **Specify placement** — "centered headline text" or "text in the upper third"
4. **Use GPT Image 1.5 or Gemini for text-heavy assets** — they understand text semantically
5. **Avoid FLUX for text** — it treats text as visual texture, not characters
6. **Check every letter** — text errors are the most common AI image failure mode
7. **Regenerate rather than edit** for text errors — editing rarely fixes misspelled text
