## Ship Pipeline

One command to go from "done coding" to "pushed and CI-ready."

### Pipeline order

1. `simplify` — code cleanup (reuse, quality, efficiency) — *if the skill is available*
2. Security review — scan for vulnerabilities
3. `e2e` — verify the feature works end-to-end — *if the skill is available*
4. Version & changelog — bump version, update CHANGELOG.md (if applicable)
5. README update — update docs if changes affect them (if applicable)
6. `commit` — commit all changes
7. `preflight` — run CI/CD checks locally
8. Push
9. Distribution tail — changelog refresh from commits, annotated semver tag, CI watch, optional publish

> Note: `simplify` and `e2e` are optional pipeline stages. If a skill by that name
> is not installed in pi, **skip that stage silently** and continue — do not fail
> the ship over a missing optional skill. `commit` and `preflight` ARE required
> and are present in pi.

### Step 1: Simplify (auto-fix) — optional

If a `simplify` skill is available, invoke it. It reviews changed code for reuse,
quality, and efficiency, then auto-fixes issues found. Wait for it to complete
before proceeding. If no such skill exists, skip this step.

### Step 2: Security Review (interactive)

Run `git diff HEAD` to get all uncommitted changes, then analyze as a senior security engineer.

**Only flag issues with >80% confidence of real exploitability.**

**Check for:**
- Input Validation: SQL injection, command injection, XXE, path traversal, template injection
- Auth & Authorization: authentication bypass, privilege escalation, session flaws
- Crypto & Secrets: hardcoded API keys/passwords/tokens, weak crypto
- Injection & Code Execution: XSS, unsafe eval, prototype pollution, deserialization

**Do NOT report:**
- Denial of Service vulnerabilities
- Secrets stored on disk
- Rate limiting or resource exhaustion
- Pre-existing issues (only flag what's NEW in the diff)
- Theoretical issues with low practical impact

**If findings exist:** Present each with severity, file/line, description, and fix. Ask: "Which findings should I fix? (all / none / comma-separated numbers)". Fix selected findings.

**If no findings:** Print "Security review: clean" and proceed.

### Step 3: E2E Test — optional

If an `e2e` skill is available, invoke it with the ship argument as the feature
context. If it finds and fixes issues, it will commit those fixes automatically.
Do NOT proceed until it reports all tests passing. If no such skill exists, skip
this step.

### Step 4: Version & Changelog (conditional)

**Detection:** Check for `CHANGELOG.md` in project root.

**If no CHANGELOG.md:** Skip this step entirely.

**If CHANGELOG.md exists:**

1. Read current version from `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `pyproject.toml`
2. Suggest bump type based on changes:
   - Bug fixes → `patch`
   - New features → `minor`
   - Breaking changes → `major`
3. Ask user: `Release: current v{version}. Bump? (patch → {x} / minor → {x} / major → {x} / skip)`
4. If user picks a bump:
   - Update version in the manifest file
   - Insert new section in CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format):
     ```
     ## [{VERSION}] - {YYYY-MM-DD}

     ### {Category}

     - {description from actual code changes}
     ```
   - Append release link to bottom of CHANGELOG.md
5. If user says "skip": proceed without versioning

### Step 5: README Update (conditional, auto)

**If no README.md:** Skip.

**If README.md exists:** Review code changes and determine if they affect documented content (new features, changed CLI flags, updated usage, removed functionality, changed API).

- If changes affect docs: update relevant sections, keep existing style
- If no doc impact: skip silently

### Step 6: Commit

Invoke the `commit` skill to commit all current changes (including version bump, changelog, README updates from steps 4-5).

If there are no unstaged/untracked changes, skip this step.

### Step 7: Preflight CI/CD

Invoke the `preflight` skill to run all CI/CD checks locally.

If `preflight` finds and fixes issues, it will commit those fixes automatically.

Do NOT proceed until `preflight` reports all checks passing.

### Step 8: Push

1. Determine branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`
   - If behind remote: `git pull --rebase origin <branch>`, then push again

> Tagging moved to Step 9 (Distribution Tail) so the tag is annotated and created only after the push lands.

### Step 9: Distribution Tail (post-push)

Runs AFTER the push succeeds. This is the "make the release real and observable" stage. Each sub-step is conditional — skip silently when it doesn't apply, never block the ship on an optional step.

**(a) Changelog refresh from commits**

- If `CHANGELOG.md` was already updated in Step 4, skip — it's current.
- If there is NO `CHANGELOG.md` and the project looks like a release artifact (has a version manifest: `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml`), offer to generate one from the git history:
  - `git log --pretty=format:'%s' {LAST_TAG}..HEAD` (or full history if no prior tag), grouped into Added / Changed / Fixed by conventional-commit prefix (`feat:`→Added, `fix:`→Fixed, else Changed).
  - Write a Keep-a-Changelog `## [{VERSION}] - {YYYY-MM-DD}` section. Commit it via the `commit` skill and re-push.
- If the project is not a release artifact (no manifest), skip silently — most of Christopher's repos are apps/configs, not published packages.

**(b) Annotated semver tag**

- Only when a version exists/was bumped (Step 4) OR the user explicitly asks to tag.
- Resolve `{VERSION}` from the manifest. Confirm it isn't already tagged: `git tag -l v{VERSION}`.
- Create an **annotated** tag (carries tagger, date, message — unlike a lightweight tag):
  - `git tag -a v{VERSION} -m "Release v{VERSION}"` (append a one-line summary of headline changes if available).
- Push it: `git push origin v{VERSION}`.
- If `v{VERSION}` already exists, do NOT overwrite — report it and skip.

**(c) Watch CI after push**

- Only if the repo has a GitHub remote and `.github/workflows/` exists and `gh` is authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- Give the run a moment to register, then watch the run for the pushed SHA:
  - `gh run watch $(gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId') --exit-status` (or poll `gh run list` if `watch` isn't available).
  - Bound the wait sensibly; if CI is still running after a reasonable window, report "CI in progress" rather than hanging.
- Report the outcome: **PASS** / **FAIL** (with the failing job + a link via `gh run view --web`) / **IN PROGRESS** / **N/A** (no CI).
- A CI **FAIL** does not un-ship the push (it's already pushed) — surface it loudly in the Final Report so the user can act.

**(d) Publish to package registries — OPTIONAL / DEFERRED**

> ⚠️ Christopher does not currently publish CLI packages. Treat this whole sub-step as OFF by default. Only run it if the project clearly publishes a package AND the user explicitly confirms.

If this project publishes a CLI / library:
- **npm:** `npm publish` (verify `package.json` `name`/`version`/`files`/`bin`, `npm whoami`, 2FA OTP if enabled; `--access public` for scoped first publish).
- **Homebrew tap:** bump the formula in the tap repo — update `url` to the new release tarball + recompute `sha256` (`shasum -a 256`), commit + push to the tap.
- Both require credentials/auth set up first — if not configured, report "publish skipped (not configured)" and move on. Never invent registry credentials.

### Rules

- Follow the pipeline order strictly — no skipping required steps (optional `simplify`/`e2e` may be skipped if the skill isn't installed)
- Each step must fully pass before moving to the next
- If any step's fix loop gets stuck (3 attempts on same error), stop the entire pipeline and ask the user for help
- Never force push — if `git push` fails for reasons other than being behind remote, stop and ask the user
- Security review is the ONLY mandatory interactive step
- Version bump is OPTIONAL — only when CHANGELOG.md exists
- Version bump + changelog + README happen BEFORE commit
- The distribution tail (Step 9) runs AFTER push: annotated tag, then CI watch
- Tags are ANNOTATED (`git tag -a`), never lightweight; never overwrite an existing tag
- A CI FAIL in Step 9 does not un-ship — report it loudly, don't silently swallow it
- Package publishing (npm/brew) is OFF by default — only with an explicit confirm + configured creds
